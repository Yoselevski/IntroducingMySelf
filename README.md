My first React project

Hey there. 
That is my first React project. 
Pretty simple and fun to move.
There isn't back-end although its pretty simple to connect this project to some database and play with it . 

For running that project, 
I suggest to use 'npm install' to install the Nodes.js , and then 'npm start' to run the server .
Hope you will have fun .
